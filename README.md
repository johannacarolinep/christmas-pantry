# Christmas Pantry

The Christmas Pantry invites its users to guess the ingredients for some of our most beloved holiday treats, hoping to entertain, challenge, and help users get into a festive mood.

The user is presented with a cake and tasked with picking out its ingredients from the pantry. The user will score points for picking the right ingredients, and lose points for picking the wrong ones. The aim is to get as high a score as possible.
